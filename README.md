hostnamr
========

A name generator which gives you easily to remember names which mean nothing!

Alorithm & History
-----------------

Super simple juggling of syllables. Please take it with tongue in cheek and
don't take it serious. It was when i recognized that in japanese you can
concatenate arbitrary hiragana syllables and come up with some pronounceble
word. This gave me the idea for hostnamr, to create (hopefully) nonsense words
and to use them as host name alternatives. Besides it was just a test drive
for some HTML and rails coding. And that was in 2005. Now i revived this to
play with some sinatra and check the redhat openshift cloud service.

Deployment
----------

This repo includes deployment details on runing this app on the openshift
cloud by redhat. Ususally i would NOT include this with this source repo, but
I still need to figure how to separate app source from deployment info in the
sinatra openshift context (and nowbody seems to care anyhow).
